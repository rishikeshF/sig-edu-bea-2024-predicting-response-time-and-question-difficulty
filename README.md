Abstract: 
In this paper, we present the details of our contribution to the BEA Shared Task on Automated Prediction of Item Difficulty and Response Time. Participants in this collaborative
effort are tasked with developing models to predict the difficulty and response time of multiple-choice items within the medical domain. These items are sourced from the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®), a significant medical assessment. In order to achieve this, we experimented with two featurization techniques, one using lingusitic features and the other using embeddings generated by BERT fine-tuned over MS-MARCO dataset. Further, we tried several different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN and Boosting models such as XGBoost and GBDT. We found that out of all the models we experimented with Random Forest Regressor trained on Linguistic features gave the least root mean squared error, securing fourteenth rank out of 43 for Item Difficulty Prediction and ninth rank out of 34 for Response Time Prediction. We made our code publicly available in this repository.
